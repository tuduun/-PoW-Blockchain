# PoWBlockchain

## Overview
`PoWBlockchain` is a comprehensive blockchain implementation that follows the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, it offers a foundational structure for a decentralized ledger system with a built-in cryptocurrency wallet.

## Features
- **Blockchain Core**: Robust blockchain logic with block creation, chain validation, and PoW consensus.
- **Proof-of-Work Consensus**: Implements the PoW consensus algorithm to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Cryptocurrency Wallet**: Manage transactions, balances, and cryptographic keys.
- **Real-time Communication**: Utilizes a publish-subscribe model for real-time data broadcasting.
- **Configurable Settings**: Adjust blockchain parameters like difficulty and rewards.
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for tasks like cryptographic hashing.

## Directory Structure
- **app**: Main application logic and server setup.
- **blockchain**: Core blockchain logic and algorithms.
- **scripts**: Utility scripts for automation.
- **util**: Helper functions used throughout the project.
- **wallet**: Cryptocurrency wallet logic and functionalities.
